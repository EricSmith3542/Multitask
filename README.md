# Multitask

This is a little demo project of mine in Unity. The premise of the game is to try and manage multiple different minigames at once for as long as possible. The project is incomplete, and will likely remain that way since I plan on pivoting my focus from Unity to Unreal Engine. I may try recreating something similar to this in Unreal in the future.
